    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Music segmentation can be seen as a change point detection task and therefore can be carried out with `ruptures`.\n",
    "Roughly, it consists in finding the temporal boundaries of homogeneous segments, e.g. the intro, verse, chorus and outro in a song.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adopted approach is summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the original sound is transformed into an informative (multivariate) representation;\n",
    "- mean shifts are detected in this new representation using a dynamic programming approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use the well-known tempogram representation, which is based on the onset strength envelope of the input signal, and captures the tempo spectrum [[Grosche2010]](#Grosche2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "To load and manipulate sound data, we use the [librosa package](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) [[McFee2015]](#McFee2015)."

    "\n",
    "We choose to detect changes in the mean of the tempogram, which is a multivariate signal.\n",

    "### Choice of the number of changes\n",
    "In order to choose the number of change points, we use the elbow method.\n",
    "In the change point detection setting, this heuritic consists in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- plotting the sum of costs for 1, 2,...,$K_{\\text{max}}$ change points,\n",
    "- picking the number of changes at the \"elbow\" of the curve (i.e. adding some additional change points gives a decreasing marginal gain on the sum of costs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we set $K_{\\text{max}}$:=20.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! note\n",
    "    In `rpt.Dynp` and `rpt.KernelCPD`, whenever a segmentation with $K$ changes is computed, all segmentations with 1,2,..., $K-1$ are also computed and stored.\n",
    "    Indeed, thanks to the dynamic programming approach, segmentations with less changes are avalaible for free as intermediate calculations.\n",
    "    Therefore, users who need to compute segmentations with several numbers of changes should start with the one with the most changes.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's summarize what we have achieved with the present example: \n",
    "\n",
    "* We focused here on representing a music soundtrack according to its tempogram,\n",
    "* We chose to detect mean shifts in the tempogram,\n",
    "* We used the search method `rpt.KernelCPD` that allows to explore efficiently several values for the number of change points,\n",
    "* We used the \"elbow\" heuritic to find the \"best\" number of change points.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the best segmentation results in 6 segments (5 change points) that best describes the shifts in the mean of the soundtrack tempogram. This is what we see in the [Result](#results) section :\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the plot with both the tempogram and change points, we see that the computed segmentation captures homogeneous tempogram portions. When the intensity around the ~100BPM increases, the segment 3 captures it as compared as to segment 2. When high BPMs continuum enters the tempogram, again the algorithm captures it with segments 4 and 6,\n",
    "* When listening to the resulting 6 segments, we can easily notice that they correspond to different rythmic portions of the soundtrack related to events of various instruments entering/exiting the play. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we dealt only with pure instrumental music soundtrack in order to showcase `ruptures` capabilities on a music segmentation task. It would be interesting to try change point detection using `ruptures` on soundtracks with lyrics. Maybe it would require to introduce some different features like the chromagram or some other more specialized ones.  \n"
