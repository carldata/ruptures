    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Music segmentation can be seen as a change point detection task and therefore can be carried out with `ruptures`.\n",
    "Roughly, it consists in finding the temporal boundaries of homogeneous segments, e.g. the intro, verse, chorus and outro in a song.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adopted approach is summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the original sound is transformed into an informative (multivariate) representation;\n",
    "- mean shifts are detected in this new representation using a dynamic programming approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use the well-known tempogram representation, which is based on the onset strength envelope of the input signal, and captures the tempo spectrum [[Grosche2010]](Grosche2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "To load and manipulate sound data, we use the [librosa package](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html) [[McFee2015]](McFee2015)."

    "### Choice of the detection algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose to detect changes in the mean of the tempogram, which is a multivariate signal.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Choice of the number of changes\n",
    "In order to choose the number of change points, we use the elbow method.\n",
    "In the change point detection setting, this heuritic consists in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- plotting the sum of costs for 1, 2,...,$K_{\\text{max}}$ change points,\n",
    "- picking the number of changes at the \"elbow\" of the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we set $K_{\\text{max}}$:=20.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! note\n",
    "    In `rpt.Dynp` and `rpt.KernelCPD`, whenever a segmentation with $K$ changes is computed, all segmentations with 1,2,..., $K-1$ are also computed and stored.\n",
    "    Indeed, thanks to the dynamic programming approach, segmentations with less changes are avalaible for free as intermediate calculations.\n",
    "    Therefore, users who need to compute segmentations with several numbers of changes should start with the one with the most changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, note that, in `ruptures`, the sum of costs of a segmentation defined by a set of change points `bkps` can easily be computed using:\n",
